# MERN_STACK_TODO_app

These project is all about atendance manegment system that i build it 
in mongoDB, Express, React and node and it has basic functionality that most app contains which is
create, read , update and delete. if you are well known tester you will notice 
there is no bug on the code that i write, may be there is some kind of bug on the libraries
that i installed.

The app is not responsive at all, couse the project is made to show only the MERN with todo 
capability and of course i didn't warry to much about the css.

The final thing that i would like to say is just that if you get bug on the actual code 
please feel free to suggest me...
